Basic Array Operations:  
1) Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array into a variable called 'neighbours' 
2) At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array  
3) Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from the end of the array  
4)If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country âGermanyâ, log to the console: 'Probably not a central European country :D'  
5)Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for 'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.  */

let neighbours = ["France", "Spain", "Italy"];
neighbours.push("Utopia");
neighbours.pop();
Step 4: Check if 'neighbours' array includes 'Germany' and log a message if it doesn't
if (!neighbours.includes("Germany")) {
    console.log("Probably not a central European country :D");
}
5)Change the name of one neighbouring country
let index = neighbours.indexOf('Spain'); // Find the index of 'Spain'
if (index !== -1) {
  neighbours[index] = 'Republic of Spain'; // Replace 'Spain' with 'Republic of Spain'
}'neighbours' array
console.log(neighbours);

Dot  Bracket Notation  
1. Using the object from the previous assignment, log a string like this to the console: 'Finland has 6 million finnish-speaking people, 3 neighbouring countries and a capital called Helsinki.'  

2. Increase the country's population by two million using dot notation, and then decrease it by two million using brackets notation.  */
let finland = {
    country: "Finland",
    population: 6,
    language: "Finnish",
    neighbours: 3,
    capital: "Helsinki"
};
console.log(`${finland.country} has ${finland.population} million ${finland.language}-speaking people, ${finland.neighbours} neighbouring countries and a capital called ${finland.capital}.`);
finland.population += 2; 
finland["population"] -= 2; 

console.log(finland.population); 
Object Methods  
1.Add a method called 'describe' to the 'myCountry' object. This method will log a string to the console, similar to the string logged in the previous assignment, but this time using the 'this' keyword. 
 2Call the 'describe' method 

3.Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This method will set a new property on the object, called 'isIsland'. 'isIsland' will be true if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if there are. Use the ternary operator to set the property.  */

 let myCountry = {
    country: 'Fr',
    capital: 'Paris',
    language: 'French',
    population: 67, // in millions
    neighbours: ['Spain', 'Germany', 'Italy']
  };
  console.log(myCountry);
There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are only 50 voters. Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting, by logging a string like this to the console (for numbers 1 to 50): 'Voter number 1 is currently voting' 
for (let i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {
    console.log(`Voter number ${i} is currently voting`);
 The while Loop  
1. Recreate the challenge from the lecture 'Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing', but this time using a while loop (call the array 'percentages3') 

  2. Reflect on what solution you like better for this task: the for loop or the while loop? 
let populations = [1441, 1380, 331, 82];
let percentages3 = [];
let i = 0;

while (i < populations.length) {
    percentages3.push(percentageOfWorld1(populations[i]));
    i++;
}

console.log(percentages3);
